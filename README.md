# Idobo Configuration
I use an [XD75 / ID75 / Idobo](https://drop.com/buy/id75-hot-swappable-ortholinear-keyboard-kit/); using this repository to store my firmware files and config.

## Files
* Hex (Via-compatible firmware)
* Config (Specific keymaps / layers I use)

## Key functions
* Tap-dancing left and right shift (tap is \[ and \], hold is the shift function)
* No caps lock; instead the button enables a second layer with FN buttons, arrow keys, and volume and media controls
* Another layer that enables mouse controls and buttons on the left side, and a regular-format number pad on the right side

## To add / explore
* Macros / shortcuts to change tabs
* Multi-tap trick on shift keys (single-tap = \[, double-tap = (, triple-tap = {)
* A custom shift layer (core keys all behave as expected with capitalization, everything else does something else weird)
* Maybe auto-shift (tap keys for regular, hold a bit for capitalization - probably don't want this for games)
* A steno layer?
